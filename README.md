# Blind Source Separation

The aim of the project is to separate the images where one image is projected onto the other. This project is for study purpose. 
 
**s1** and **s2** be two images such that  they are not gaussian.
**x1** and **x2** be two images which are linear combination of s1 and s2.

let **A** be the SVD matrix where **A** = **U** * **W** * **V**

Here **U**, **V** perform rotation and **W** for scaling.

**X** = **AS**
